First level of جنة is where souls ascend.
May سلام be upon you and your sorrows mend.
Your عمل rewarded beyond earthly measure.
Your شهوة filled with sexual pleasure.

One level higher, curiosity commands,
Infinite pleasures, sensory expands.
Savory feasts or cosmic bands,
Garden scents or loving hands?
Lustful peaks or intimate connections,
Indulge them all, no exceptions.

New odyssey wait, for a hero without fear.

At level 4, where souls seek their fix,
A single machine vends, a craving mix.
With infinite desires, in a pleasure stream,
Is a hedonistic fantasy, a heavenly dream.
