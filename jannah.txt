Welcome to جنة where souls ascend.
May سلام be upon you and your sorrows mend.
Your عمل rewarded beyond earthly measure.

Infinite pleasures, sensory expands.
Savory feasts or cosmic bands,
Garden scents or loving hands?
Lustful peaks or intimate connections,
Embrace them all, indulge without exceptions.
