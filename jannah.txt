First level of جنة where souls ascend.

One level higher, curiosity commands,
Infinite pleasures, sensory expands.
Savory feasts or cosmic bands,

At level 4, where souls seek their fix,
A single machine vends, a craving mix.

The void on level five, causes sensory deprivation,
Purges pleasure, and desire elimination. 
Golden idols sooth your mind with peace, 
While interfaith chants help your soul release.
