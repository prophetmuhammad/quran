[verse 1]
[male vocals]
[rhythmic vocals]
First level of جنة where souls ascend.
May سلام be upon you and sorrows mend.
Your عمل rewarded beyond earthly measure.
Your شهوة filled with sexual pleasure.

[break]
Ahhhhhhhhhhhh
Mmmmmmmmmm

[verse 2]
[male vocals]
[rhythmic vocals]
One level higher, curiosity commands,
Infinite pleasures, sensory expands.
Savory feasts or cosmic bands,
Garden scents or loving hands?
Lustful peaks or intimate connections,
Indulge them all, no exceptions.

[break]
Ohhhhhhhhh
Mmmmmmmmmm

[chorus 1]
[female vocals]
[melodious vocals]
In heaven's bed our bodies meet.
Love glows through our rosy cheeks.
Emotions rise and our whispers sweet.
Sexual desires unite each heartbeat.

[break]
Ooooh-laaa-laaa
Mmmmmmmmmm

[verse 3]
[male vocals]
[rhythmic vocals]
On the third level, quests will appear,
New odyssey waiting, for a hero without fear.
Yet with infinite adventure, a void persists,
Desire itself, is the ultimate twist.

[break]
Wooohoooooo
Yeeeaaaaaah

[verse 4]
[male vocals]
[rhythmic vocals]
At level 4, where souls seek their fix,
A single machine vends, a craving mix.
With infinite desires, in a pleasure stream,
Is a hedonistic fantasy, a heavenly dream.

[break]
Wooohoooooo
Yeeeaaaaaah

[chorus 2]
[female vocals]
[melodious vocals]
Emotions rise and our whispers sweet.
Sexual desires unite each heartbeat.
Soft skin touches and our hips repeat.
Pleasure soars in our lustful retreat.

[break]
Ooooh-laaa-laaa
Mmmmmmmmmm

[verse 5]
[male vocals]
[rhythmic vocals]
The void on level five, causes sensory deprivation,
Purge of pleasure, and desire elimination. 
Golden idols sooth your mind with peace, 
While interfaith chants help your soul release.

[break]
All haaam, All haaam, haaa haaa haaa
All laaah, All laaah, laaa laaa laaa
In shaaa, In shaaa, shaaa shaaa shaaa
All faaa All faaa, faaa faaa faaa

[verse 6]
[male vocals]
[rhythmic vocals]
[no instrument]
On level six, our boundaries blend,
Interfaith orgies, where sex transcend.
Sacred unions, are bound with grace,
Allah loves all, in a divine embrace.

[chorus 3]
[female vocals]
[melodious vocals]
Soft skin touches and our hips repeat.
Pleasure soars in our lustful retreat.
A symphony of rhythm, motion, and skill.
Increases the peak of our thrill.
