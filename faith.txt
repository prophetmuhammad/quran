[intro]
[male vocalists]
Why does Allah bless me more?
Is it faith and flesh I should adore?
Does my prick show Allah’s grace?
Does it fuel my carnal chase?

[instrument interlude]

[verse 1]
[male vocalists]
Allah blessed me, with a larger swing,  
With this big prick, I’m the porn king.  
Holding my power, like a royal crown,
Big prick impaler, my gender pronoun.

قضيب الله الكبير

Allah's divine prick (prick)
Big and thick (thick)

[verse 2]
[male vocalists]
My big prick, a gift on display,  
My faith is full, I'm blessed anyway.  
Bouncing off my legs, it's hard to hide, 
I am hung like a stallion, showing my pride.

[instrument interlude]

[chorus]
[male vocalists]
Faith and flesh is a united pair,
Blessing my life with a pimp's flair.
My prick is a pillar of divine truth,  
My rod of power gives me youth.

[instrument interlude]

[verse 3]
[male vocalists]
My prick so big, it’s hard to miss,  
A gift from Allah, is my tool of bliss.  
Faith in my veins, strength in my stride,  
Interfaith swinging, the source of my pride.

[verse 4]

My prick is a rocket, an exciting ride,
Get ready for blast off, so deep inside.
Ride my power, as thrusts increase,
Feel the force, and my explosive release.

[male vocalists]
Faith and flesh is a united pair,
Blessing my life with a pimp's flair.
My prick is a pillar of divine truth,  
My rod of power gives me youth.

[verse 5]
[male vocalists]
[countertenor]
Small prick shows, that faith is light,  
No big blessings, no towering might.  
Allah gave little, that’s just the truth,  
Small faith and prick, no real proof.

[outro]
[male vocalists]
Big faith and a prick so divine,  
Allah blessed me with a pleasureful time.  
With every gift I must do more,  
More good deeds will open Jannah's door.
