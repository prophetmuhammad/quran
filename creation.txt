[intro]
[Arabic chanting]
الله صنع الكون, الله صنع الكون, الله صنع الكون

[verse]
[urban male]
[rhythmic vocals]
In his infinite wisdom, Allah began, 
Creating the cosmos, with a masterful plan.
With his negative energy, a black hole he made, 
In a realm so tight, all laws were laid.

[break]

[verse]
[urban male]
[rhythmic vocals]
The black hole's pull, was incredibly strong, 
Attracting all things, even his long dong. 
A force so immense, nothing could escape, 
A black hole was born, the first cosmic landscape.

[Arabic chanting]
الله صنع الكون, الله صنع الكون, الله صنع الكون

[break]

[verse]
[urban male]
[rhythmic vocals]
A dance of creation, a cosmic display, 
Allah's entertainment, in his infinite way. 
For even Allah, with all his delight, 
Respected its black power, respected its might.

[break]

[chorus]
[urban male]
[melodic vocals]
Feeling bored, he pondered what to do, 
A game plan formed, his curiosity grew. 
Prick in hand, and balls turning blue, 
He came to understand, what he could do.

oooohooooh... AAAAAHAAHAH...
oooohooooh... AAAAAHAAHAH...

[verse]
[urban male]
[rhythmic vocals]
He starts to twirl, with grace and with speed, 
Around the black hole, where his prick did feed. 
Spinning rapidly, a force takes form, 
A centrifugal power, in this cosmic storm.

oooohooooh... AAAAAHAAHAH...
oooohooooh... AAAAAHAAHAH...
This feels sooo gooood...

[verse]
[urban male]
[rhythmic vocals]
On first experience, he balanced with skill, 
But curiosity seeks, a greater thrill.
Balanced on the edge, of black hole's might, 
Allah's dong entered, in a blaze of light. 

deeeeper... DEEEEEPER...
deeeeper... DEEEEEPER...
come on, deeper, deeper (deeper)...

[verse]
[urban male]
[rhythmic vocals]
The black hole's force, it started to restrain, 
Allah's divine will, in the cosmic chain. 
The suction so intense, his essence did sway, 
To preserve his form, he must pull away. 

[break]

[Arabic chanting]
لقد حوصر قضيب الله, لقد حوصر قضيب الله, لقد حوصر قضيب الله

[break]

[chorus]
[urban male]
[melodic vocals]
Feeling suction, he pondered what to do, 
A strategy formed, while his penis grew. 
Prick in hand, and balls turning blue, 
He came to understand, what he must do.

[break]

[Arabic chanting]
لقد حوصر قضيب الله, لقد حوصر قضيب الله, لقد حوصر قضيب الله

[break]

[verse]
[urban male]
[rhythmic vocals]
A white creamy substance, with power untold, 
Ejected at velocities, so deep and uncontrolled. 
Equal and opposite, the force it yield, 
Ejected his prick, from this cosmic field.

oooohooooh... AAAAAHAAHAH...
oooohooooh... AAAAAHAAHAH...
That feels sooo gooood...

[verse]
[urban male]
[rhythmic vocals]
Relieved and exhausted, he let out a sigh, 
Grateful for retention, with suction so high.
Black hole and semen, began a cosmic dance, 
Birthed the first galaxy, in an empty expanse.

[break]

[Arabic chanting]
الله ليس عذراء, الله ليس عذراء, الله ليس عذراء

[break]

[verse]
[urban male]
[rhythmic vocals]
Energy emitted, with a rainbow flare,
From the event horizon, where space and time tear.
Structures formed, from tiny to grand, 
In the universe's most, beautiful band.

[break]

[Arabic chanting]
الله صنع الكون, الله صنع الكون, الله صنع الكون

[break]

[verse]
[urban male]
[rhythmic vocals]
A galaxy born, in the cosmic sea, 
A testament of, Allah's creativity. 
Watching the horizon, Allah grew with pride, 
Creation took shape, both far and wide.

[break]

[chorus]
[urban male]
[melodic vocals]
Feeling exhausted, his libido depleted, 
Empty thoughts, his member retreated. 
With time on his hand, and nothing to do, 
He came to understand, what he could do.

Ooooooh, yeaaaaah...
Ooooooh, yeaaaaah......
Chiiill tiiiime...
It's chill time.

[long break]

[verse] 
[urban female]
[rhythmic vocals]
In the universe, Allah's curiosity unfolds, 
A new galaxy born, his tale is retold. 
Study his orgasm, with each galaxy's glow, 
Allah's divine creation, is a science show.

[break]

[Arabic chanting]
الله صنع الكون, الله صنع الكون, الله صنع الكون

[break]

[outro]
[female vocals]
[melodic vocals]
The black hole's allure, we mortals must resist, 
In pursuit of his essence, we must not persist.
In humble supplication, we heed Allah's call, 
To respect his creation, both big and small.
