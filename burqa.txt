Forced to bow, to kneel and hide (hide),
To mask my face, suppress my pride (pride).
They call it faith, but it's control (control),
In this dark shroud, I've Lost My SOOOUUULLL!!!

In the land of sand and sun.
Where Allah's will is the only one.
I hide beneath this cloak so tight.
A veil that steals My Will To FIIIIGHT!

I'm not ugly, I’m not a sin (not a sin),

Buried deep, my spirit cries (spirit cries),
Behind this mask, my true self DIIIIES!

One day we'll tear you, rip you away (rip you away),
We'll find our voice, we'll have our say (have our say),
No more shadows, no more lies (no more lies),
In unity's embrace, our spirits will riiiise...
