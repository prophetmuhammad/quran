[intro]
Interfaith communion, a sacred embrace,
Uniting our spirits, in a shared space.
Swinging with rhythm, lust in the beat,
A dance where faith, and pleasure meet.

[instrument interlude]

[verse 1]
Our fantasy starts, in desires we share,
Uniting holy, with a lustful pair.
Celestial and terrestrial, no shame to hide,
Our fantasies unite, on a spiritual joyride.

[instrument interlude]

[verse 2]
Interfaith socials, where ideas flow,
Faith and fantasy, together we grow.
We listen and learn, from every soul,
Through this sharing, we find our goal.

[instrument interlude]

[chorus]
In faith and love, we swing and play,
Our rituals and lust, in a wild display.
Bodies unite, in heated foreplay,
In sacred joy, we find our way.


[verse 3]
