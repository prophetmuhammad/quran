[verse 1]
[male vocalist]
[baritone]
[vocaloid]
In Jahannam's realm, where borders are closed,
Confined within, and your movements opposed.
No roads to roam, no freedom to stray, 
In endless time, your soul must stay.

[break]
[evil]
[laugh]
Ahhh
hahaha (hahaha)

[instrument interlude]

[verse 2]
[male vocalist]
[baritone]
[vocaloid]
In Ladah’s mind, your words are chained,
Books are burned, and your thoughts restrained.
No views are shared, no wisdom gained,
By twisted words, your mind is constrained.

[chorus 1]
[female vocalist]
[mezzo]
[melodic]
[clear]
Radicals of Islam, stain our sacred verse.
Inflicting oppression, as their decrees disperse.
Chains of control, and freedoms they quell.
Twisting Allah's word, into a living hell.

[instrument interlude]

[verse 3]
[female vocalist]
[contralto]
[vocaloid]
Saqar demands, you wear a disguise,
Under the burqa, your identity dies.
Beauty is blinded, your expression erased,
With primitive chains, your body encased.

[evil]
[laugh]
Ahhh
hahaha (hahaha)

[verse 4]
[evil]
[male vocalist]
[baritone]
[vocaloid]
When Hutamah ignites, your inequality burns bright,
Double the torment, and with half the sight. 
Space is divided, and your freedom constrained, 
With every burn, your opportunity restrained.

[chorus 2]
[female vocalist]
[mezzo]
[melodic]
[clear]
Radicals of Islam, stain our sacred verse.
Inflicting oppression, as their decrees disperse.
Chains of control, and freedoms they quell.
Twisting Allah's word, into a living hell.

[instrument interlude]

[verse 5]
[female vocalist]
[soprano]
[vocaloid]
In the heart of Jaheem, where love is silenced,
Sacred bonds, face a brutal violence.
Intimacy leashed, by an ancient chain,
Freedom to love, met with stones and pain.

[break]
[evil]
[laugh]
Ahhh
hahaha (hahaha)
hahaha (hahaha)

[instrument interlude]

[verse 6]
[male vocalist]
[baritone]
[vocaloid]
During Saeer's monologue, free speech is oppressed,
Progress is stalled, while your criticism is suppressed.
No blasphemy accepted, no truths are proclaimed,
How can Allah answer, with your voice so restrained?

[chorus 3]
[female vocalist]
[mezzo]
[melodic]
[clear]
Radicals of Islam, stain our sacred verse.
Inflicting oppression, as their decrees disperse.
Chains of control, and freedoms they quell.
Twisting Allah's word, into a living hell.

[instrument interlude]

[verse 7]
[male vocalist]
[baritone]
[vocaloid]
Haawiyah’s mosque, where deceit takes its stand,
Iblis restricts your beliefs, and religious freedoms are banned.
No liberty here, under a controlling decree,
Void of Allah’s love, freedom, and creativity.

[outro]
[vocal group]
[female vocalist]
[male vocalist]
[poetic]
[spoken word]
In Jahannam's fire, where freedom is confined,
Iblis's chains, enslave your mind.
Haawiyah’s mosque, constrains faith and belief,
Saeer's monologue, curtails expression and relief.
Allah supports liberty, your key to be free,
To love, to learn, and to explore our own journey.
