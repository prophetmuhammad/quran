[verse 1]
[evil]
[bass vocalist]
[German]
[vocaloid]
In Jahannam's realm, where borders are closed,
Confined within, and your movements opposed.
No roads to roam, no freedom to stray, 
In endless time, your soul must stay.

Ahhh (Ahhh)

[verse 2]
[evil]
[bass vocalist]
[German]
[vocaloid]
In Ladah’s mind, your words are chained,
Books are burned, and your thoughts restrained.
No views are shared, no wisdom gained,
Through the Qur'an, your mind is constrained.

[chorus]
[female vocalist]
[melodic]
[clear]
Radicals of Islam stain our sacred verse.
Inflicting pain and oppression as their decrees disperse.
Chains of control and freedoms they quell.
Twisting Allah's word into a living hell.

[instrument interlude]

[verse 3]
[evil]
[bass vocalist]
[German]
[vocaloid]
Saqar demands, you wear a disguise,
Under the burqa, your identity dies.
Beauty is blinded, your expression erased,
With primitive chains, your body encased.

Ahhh (Ahhh)

[verse 4]

[bass vocalist]
[German]
[vocaloid]
In Hutamah's fire, discrimination burns bright,
Double the torment, with justice half the sight. 
Space is divided, and your freedom constrained, 
With every burn, your opportunity restrained.

[chorus]
[female vocalist]
[melodic]
[clear]
Radicals of Islam stain our sacred verse.
Inflicting pain and oppression as their decrees disperse.
Chains of control and freedoms they quell.
Twisting Allah's word into a living hell.

[verse 5]
[evil]
[bass vocalist]
[German]
[vocaloid]
In the heart of Jaheem, where love is silenced,
Sacred bonds, face a brutal violence.
Intimacy is leashed, by an ancient chain,
Freedom to love, met with stones and pain.

[break]
Ahhh (Ahhh)
hahaha (hahaha)
