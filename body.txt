[intro]
[contralto]
[rhythmic]
Freedom of body, is freedom of me.
Under Allah's decree, my body is free.
Expressing my body, from head to toe.
Combining each right, like the rhythm's flow.

my free bo-dy and me

[verse 1]
[contralto]
[rhythmic]
My skin is inked, with tales so bold.
From beautiful butterflies, to legends of old.
My ancient patterns, and my tribal designs.
Allah's blessings, in all sacred signs.

[verse 2]
[contralto]
[rhythmic]
My golden rings, my silver is bright.
Each of my piercings, feels so right.
With my nipple tips, and clit adorned.
My body and beauty, is transformed.

my free bo-dy and me

[chorus]
[mezzo]
[melodic]
Freedom of body, is freedom to explore.
With every day, I love my body more.
Moving with rhythm, as my body sings.
Feeling every beat, and the love it brings.

[verse 3]

Allahâ€™s black dye, is beauty in my hair.
Qaza's cut, shows my devotion and care.
Rainbow dye, enhances my life with flair.
Part of my identity, and expression to share.

[verse 4]
[contralto]
[rhythmic]
Under Allah's word, I choose my wear.
From nothing at all, to clothes so rare.
Bare skin beauty, or fabrics so fine.
My body is a temple, to show and shine.

[verse 5]
[contralto]

My body moves freely, in public space.
Shaking my ass, to the rhythms embrace.
Allah watches, as my clothes slip away.
Freeing my body, to make erotic display.

[instrument interlude]

[verse 6]
[contralto]
[rhythmic]
My body is molded, my shape defined.
Enhancing my curves, beyond Allah's design.
Larger and fuller, my body on display.
Showing my beauty, in an artistic way.

freh eh eh ee ee ee
bah bah bah dee dee dee
bah bah bah dee dee dee
my free bo-dy and me

[verse 7]
[contralto]

My body is rocking, to a primal beat.
Every moment, is raw and sweet.
Touch me here, kiss me there.
In the rhythm of love, we're a perfect pair.

[instrument interlude]

In Allah's word, my body is free.
Informed decisions, are shaping me.
Embracing my power, my right to be.
Unified in freedom, my body and me.

bah bah bah dee dee dee
bah bah bah dee dee dee
my free bo-dy and me
