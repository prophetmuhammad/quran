Freedom of mind, is a powerful key.
Under Allah's decree, my speech is free.  
Sharing my belief, and each lesson to teach.
Unified in freedom, my mind and speech.

When emotional stress and tensions climb.
Insulting Allah, can ease my mind.
With unfiltered speech, my stress relieved.
In the chaos of words, my peace is achieved.

Question the pillars, let doubt thrive.
In honest debates, my mind comes alive.
Public critique, and doubts on display.
With a critical mind, I'll find my way.

Once a year, I renounce my faith.
During Ramadan, I cleanse my space.

When whispers fail, I shout it wide.
Public wisdom, will serve as my guide.

Share my fantasy, let my passion be known.
