[intro]
Freedom of mind, is my essence and key.
It shapes every word, so my speech is free.
It guides my belief, and philosophy to preach.
It unifies freedom, my mind and speech.

[verse 1]
When emotional stress and tensions climb.
Insulting Allah, can ease my mind.
In unfiltered speech, my stress is relieved.
In chaos of words, my peace is achieved.

[verse 2]
When a prophet descends, into sin and lust.
Marries the young, and betrays Allah's trust.
When power strays, I must be bold.
Speak truth to power, and let justice unfold.

[chorus]
Freedom of mind, unlocks my voice.
In every word, I make my choice.
Speaking with passion, as my mind sings.
Sharing verity, and the lucidity it brings.

[instrument interlude]

[verse 3]
Question the pillars, and let scrutiny thrive.
In dialectic debates, my mind comes alive.
Public critique, and doubt on display.
With a critical mind, I'll find my way.

During Ramadan, Allah must take a break.
All of the prayers, cause a divine headache.
I renounce my faith, to find peace of mind.
I cleanse my beliefs, to let doubts unwind.

I explore a path, where thought is free.
Discovering Allah, in religious diversity.
Break from the past, and embrace the new.
Exploring faiths, I'll find my view.

When whispers fail, I shout it wide.
Public wisdom, will serve as my guide.
Marital strife or intimate woe.
With public discourse, my solutions will grow.

Declare my dream, let it be heard.
In open speech, with every word.
I flirt and seduce, my desire is shown.
Share my fantasy, let my passion be known.

In Allah's word, my mind is free.
Evidence-based decisions, are guiding me.  
In truth and wisdom, my voice will reach.
Unified in freedom, my mind and speech.
