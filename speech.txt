Freedom of mind, is a powerful key.
Under Allah's decree, my speech is free.  
Sharing my belief, and a lesson to teach.
Unified in freedom, my mind and speech.

When emotional stress and tensions climb.
Insulting Allah, can ease my mind.
With unfiltered words, my stress relieved.
In the chaos of words, my peace is achieved.

[verse 2]
When a prophet falls, to sin and lust.
Marries the young, and betrays Allah's trust.
When power strays, I must be bold.
Speak truth to power, and let justice unfold.

Freedom of mind, unlocks my voice.
In every word, I make my choice.
Speaking with passion, as my mind sings.
Sharing every truth, and the clarity it brings.

Question the pillars, let doubt thrive.
In honest debates, my mind comes alive.
Public critique, and doubts on display.
With a critical mind, I'll find my way.

Once a year, I renounce my faith.
During Ramadan, I cleanse my mental space.
Detox my mind, and let doubts unwind.
With Allah's blessing, I reset my mind.

When whispers fail, I shout it wide.
Public wisdom, will serve as my guide.
Marital strife or intimate woe.
In public opinions, my solutions will grow.
